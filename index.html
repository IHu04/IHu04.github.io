            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Isaac, currently studying at McGill University, pursuing a major in Computer Science. When I'm not diving into the world of academia, you'll often find me exploring a myriad of interests that fuel my life.</p>
            <p>My interests span across a spectrum that keeps my life vibrant and exciting. Here's a glimpse into what keeps me going: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fitness and Bodybuilding: I find solace in the rhythm of pumping iron and sculpting a better version of myself every day. The discipline and dedication in fitness resonate deeply with my pursuit of excellence in other aspects of life.</li>
                <li>Music Enthusiast: Beyond textbooks and screens, I find peace in playing the piano and immersing myself in the melodies of various genres. Music transcends boundaries and fuels my creativity.</li>
                <li>Gaming for Creativity: Video games are not just a hobby; they are a canvas for creativity and problem-solving. I enjoy the artistry and narrative complexities that some games offer.</li>

            </ul>
            <p class = "conclusion">Coding is more than a skill; it's a canvas for innovation and creation. It's where my diverse interests converge, allowing me to blend the structured logic of coding with the creativity and problem-solving I've cultivated through fitness, music, and games. Whether it's designing a website or crafting an algorithm, coding empowers me to create, innovate, and bring ideas to life.
